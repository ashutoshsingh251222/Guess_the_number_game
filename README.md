# Guess_the_number_game
Thats my first project 
This is a Guess the number game !
Step 1 - I used a random keyword to generate the random variable from the computer...
Step 2 - I took the number from 0 to 100 from the user as a guess...
Step 3 - Used if else-if and else condition to check his/her gussed number condition ...
Step 4 - To exit the game I assigned the negative value (If the user uses negative value he will exit the game)...



Thanks
